        </h3>
        <div class="text">
            <p>
                Gender Equity is a reachable, but distant milestone to which everyone can contribute by becoming more open-minded and establishing an inclusive society. 
            </p>
            <p class="reasons">
                However, there are several issues we have to solve by reestablishing the stereotypical mindset in the society and changing the environment we work in on everyday basis. Here is a short list of the major problems we have to tackle with:

                    Difference in salaries between men and women is one of the causes of poverty throughout the world. It comes from stereotypical type of view that women are bad negotiators, which thereafter affects various aspects of life, such as lack of self-sufficiency, responsibilities and low standards of life for women. Even if we take a look on statistics, every woman employed for the same job position as man gets, in average, only 77 percent of what men earn.

            There are multiple restrictions imposed on educational rights for women. One of the devastating cases happened recently is prohibition by Talibs of the only occupation women could have obtained in Afghanistan, which is nursing. This caused in rise of maternal fertility rate, which is 638 per 100,000 women in 2024. The reasoning behind this rate is a passed law, that in case of child birth accompanied with male nurses another legal guardian should be present during this procedure. Conversely, if female nurse assists the process of giving birth to child, it is not required to have another legal guardian present there. 
It exacerbated the case of women since 2021, when de facto authorities took away the right of gaining secondary and high education for women. It resulted in the plunging rate of literate girls and educated women. With every year, the statistics get worse and worse. In 2021, there were over 1.4 million women departed from educational institutions because of de facto authorities. For 2023, there were additional 300,000 women forbidden to continue their education. Up to date, it added up to 2.5 million uneducated Afghan women, who are able to get educated only through alternative ways represented by UNESCO, such as employment of teachers in 20 provinces out of 34 to lecture classes for mostly girls that do not have right to proceed their education (it helped over 55,000 women to get educated regardless the governmental oppression), radio stations giving classes to over 17 million Afghan uneducated people and much more. But there is still space to work on, because these alternative ways of receiving education is incomparable to the benefits gained from attending face-to-face classes.

                The low rate of women employment in high-level industries, which according to analytics is about 26 percent, is common and mainly caused by the high demand in STEM-related jobs. This phenomenon is commonly called “glass ceiling”, when women cannot get a job in high-level industrial jobs. Because of this convention, the capabilities and skills of women in STEM fields are frequently underestimated. To equalize the chances of getting degree in hard science concentrations, many institutions are promoting scholarships for women applying for a major in scope of the STEM subjects, easing the financial burden for getting education in selected field. Women are also underrepresented in politics, as we can see from statistics that Parlement seats are filled out just with less than 10 percent of women.

            FGM, that stands for female gentile mutilation, is a terrible practice among women when female gentile organs have been intentionally cut, damaged or eliminated. It is common in African countries, accounting for 144 million, Asia with over 80 million and the least is in Middle East with recorded 8 million cases. Carrying out FGM on girls that is mostly against their will (the average varies from 9 to 10) started to be ritual for women for becoming marriageable or on the basis of adherent religion, believing in concept that sex is a sin, purifying yourself in this way. That is also interlinking cause of early marriage in such countries, like in parts of Kenya, Sierra Leone, and Somalia, because of the belief that after this procedure you are suitable for marriage regardless the age.

        </div>
        <div class="text2">
            <p class="pg">
                Since Ukrainian war broke out, my mother and the rest of family had to move to Poland to ensure safety for us there. As we moved in Lublin, one of the cities in Poland, we encountered financial difficulties and my mum tried to find the job as an architect, because she got a Master’s degree in architecture in “Kyiv National University of Architecture and Construction”. But she could not have been employed anywhere except of low paying job positions, because the employers believed that her degree is unacceptable and she is suitable to work only for “feminine” job positions, like cleaning staff. She had to live in such reality of public discrimination for over two years until we had opportunity to move to Portugal because of my father’s job offer to work in construction company. However, after a while, the construction company, where my father worked closed down and my mother started looking for work that will be at least tangentially related to her major as an architect. Up to date, her efforts to get employed for such job positions were in vain, as she has only basic level of knowledge of Portuguese language. Even though she knows Polish on B2, English on B1 level, Ukrainian and Russian fluently, she still cannot get hired due to unfamiliarity with the local language (or local second language, which is French). In addition, my mother brings up my little brother, Kiril, who currently attends 1st grade in Portuguese primary school and had to spend a handful time on him starting from taking him to the school, preparing lunchbox for him every day, preparing dinner for the entire family and ending with walking him back from school and learning Portuguese with him while helping to do his homework.

            <br>
            <p class="pg">
                That is why my mother has no other way except of continuing learning Portuguese, as she cannot work on hard labor jobs (she is 48), she has time restrictions, as she also has to take care of my brother and had to tackle with financial difficulties on everyday basis. She cannot continue her career path as she planned when she graduated, because she dedicates her all time on so called “feminine” responsibilities. She brought up me, my two elder sisters and now she spends her time on my little brother. She also cooks meals for my little brother and rest of family and thus she does not have any spare time left on developing her business in architect industry. I feel, that my mother is not the only example of such unfairness encountered in her life and majority of women cannot continue their intended career path because of fostering younger generation that will become a backbone of the future development in the world. In few countries, mothers are get paid off for the birth of the child, however, it is still a large issue in our modern world as many other states do not follow the same scheme. I believe, this problem that every mother faces with from day to day, when they devote the large part of their life on making up new generation, has to be considered and not neglected worldwide. That is why I created this website to put this issue to public attention and make others aware of the dwelling issues gender inequity creates in our society.

                From my perspective, I and Lehigh community can substantially contribute to the project “Soaring Together” by putting publicly the issue of gender inequity as part of “First Year Experience” classes or, if there will be large audience interested in how to manage this problem, it can be organized as one of the courses to choose in studying gender equity and it’s huge benefits in case of reaching it, such as a partial solution for poverty, gender inequity and discrimination, high level of unemployment and healthcare issues. By solving and reaching gender equity, we can restructure conservative mindset of solving global issues and reach long-term fruits, that will revolutionize the future industry.
